How to run code on a fitted file:

1) Create a config file similar to example.ini 

2) Run derived_from_fitted.py with command line arguments of the config file and the path to the fitted file relative to dataPath in the config file.


Specific example for ISINGLASS experiment:

1) Modify isinglass_test.ini so that dataPath is the path to the isinglass.v03 directory. With AMISR_PROCESSED mounted to Volumes, this is:

dataPath=/Volumes/AMISR_Processed/processed_data/varneytest/isinglass.v03/

2. If it doesn't exist, create the directory run_results in resolvedvelocities2d:

mkdir run_results

3. Run derive_from_fitted.py:

python derive_from_fitted.py isinglass_test.ini 20170215.005/20170215.005_lp_1min-fitcal.h5

This will take a while to run and should create a bunch of subdirectories with *.mat files in run_results.
